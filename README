The files in this directory and all sub-directories are used for demonstrations
in the course of teaching UNIX programming at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics
of Charles University in Prague (http://www.mff.cuni.cz/).

The page of the course: http://mff.devnull.cz/

All the files with examples are in Public Domain, unless marked otherwise.

The source cdde files are kept like this on purpose:
  - not all return values are checked and reacted upon
  - each file is self contained (i.e. not libraries of common functions)

This is to help understand the concepts easily.

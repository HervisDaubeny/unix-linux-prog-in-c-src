/*
 * Basic example on how to construct a pipe.  Note especially the following:
 *
 *   - the write end of the pipe is closed in the consumer
 *     - that is so that all references to that end are closed once the producer
 *       is done so the consumer can get a proper EOF and not hang indefinitely.
 *
 *   - the read end of the pipe is closed in the producer
 *     - that is so if the consumer ends up prematurely the producer will get a
 *       SIGPIPE to indicate a lack of readers (otherwise it would fill the pipe
 *       buffer and block indefinitely and that would not be acceptable).
 *
 *   - a pipe is constructed from a producer to a consumer (data flow - wise)
 *
 * The program will run /bin/ls in the child and pipe its output to the parent
 * which exec's less(1) on the input from its pipe end.
